# Clint Williams' Web Portfolio

Welcome to my personal web portfolio! This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a Full Stack Engineer. It is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional journey and technical expertise.

## Project Overview
This portfolio is a static website that highlights:
- **About Me**: A brief introduction to my background and interests.
- **Experience**: Details of my professional roles and responsibilities.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my key projects with descriptions and technologies used.

## Current Tech Stack
The current version of this portfolio is built using:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including custom properties for theming.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in social links and other elements.
- **Google Fonts**: For typography, specifically the Inter typeface.

## Planned Updates
I plan to enhance this portfolio by:
- **Migrating to Vue.js**: To introduce interactivity and improve maintainability.
- **Adopting Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first approach to styling, enabling faster and more consistent design updates.
